## My Data Science Projects

### Project 1 : Unsupervised Learning - PCA & tSNE
In this project we will explore dimensionality reduction using PCA & tSNE algorithm. We will be using the inbuilt Iris dataset from sklearn package. The data contains information about three types of Iris flower - Setosa, Versicolour & Virginica. For every type of flower there are four features sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. 

- EDA to identify any patterns or correlation between features 
- Use PCA with 2 components to reduce dimensionality and visualize the data 
- Use tSNE with 2 components to reduce dimensionality and visualize the data
